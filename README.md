<h2>Description<h2>
<p> So I'm making a random dog picture generator because the original api i wanted to use doesn't work anymore, so I went with dogs. At first when i added "get new dog" button, it would add a new picture on the page and not swap to a different photo(I'm writing this after the fact so i forgot how did it, part of me feel it was changing the getElementId another part feels it's the html). Then I added "show the breed" button.</p>
